Notes on individual issues:
===========================

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8281658: Add a security category to the java -XshowSettings option
======================================================================

The `-XshowSettings` launcher option now has a 'security' category, allowing
the following arguments to be passed:

* -XshowSettings:security or -XshowSettings:security:all: show all security settings and continue
* -XshowSettings:security:properties - show security properties and continue
* -XshowSettings:security:providers - show static security provider settings and continue
* -XshowSettings:security:tls - show TLS related security settings and continue

The output will include third-party security providers if they are
included in the application class path or module path, and configured
in the java.security file.

JDK-8316138: Add GlobalSign 2 TLS root certificates
===================================================
The following root certificates have been added to the cacerts
truststore:

Name: GlobalSign
Alias Name: globalsignr46
Distinguished Name: CN=GlobalSign Root R46, O=GlobalSign nv-sa, C=BE

Name: GlobalSign
Alias Name: globalsigne46
Distinguished Name: CN=GlobalSign Root E46, O=GlobalSign nv-sa, C=BE

security-libs/javax.security:

JDK-8328638: Fallback Option For POST-only OCSP Requests
========================================================
JDK-8179503, introduced in OpenJDK 17, added support for using the
HTTP GET method for OCSP requests. This was turned on unconditionally
for small requests.

RFC 5019 and RFC 6960 explicitly allow and recommend the use of HTTP
GET requests.  However, some OCSP responders have been observed to not
work well with such requests.

With this release, the JDK system property
`com.sun.security.ocsp.useget` is introduced. The default setting is
'true' which retains the current behaviour of using GET requests for
small requests. If the property is instead set to 'false', only HTTP
POST requests will be used, regardless of size.

This option is non-standard and may be removed again if problematic
OCSP responders are no longer an issue.

infrastructure/build:

JDK-8326891: Prefer RPATH over RUNPATH for $ORIGIN rpaths in internal JDK binaries
==================================================================================
Native executables and libraries in the JDK use embedded runtime
search paths to locate required internal JDK native libraries.  On
Linux systems, there are two ways of specifying these search paths;
DT_RPATH and DT_RUNPATH.

The main difference between the two options is that paths specified by
DT_RPATH are searched before those in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable, whereas DT_RUNPATH paths are considered afterwards. This
means the use of DT_RUNPATH can allow JDK internal libraries to be
overridden by libraries of the same name found on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Builds of earlier OpenJDK releases left the choice of which type of
runtime search path to use down to the default of the linker. With
this release, the option `--disable-new-dtags` is explicitly passed to
the linker to avoid setting DT_RUNPATH.

tools/jpackage:

JDK-8295111: dpkg appears to have problems resolving symbolically linked native libraries
=========================================================================================
The jpackage tool uses `dpkg -S` to lookup which package provides a
particular file on Debian and Ubuntu systems. However, on newer Debian
and Ubuntu systems, `dpkg -S` does not resolve symlinks. In this
OpenJDK release, jpackage now resolves symlinks before passing the
real path of the file to dpkg.

hotspot/gc:

JDK-8314573: G1: Heap resizing at Remark does not take existing eden regions into account
=========================================================================================
To comply with the settings of `-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio` and
`-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio`, the G1 garbage collector adjusts the Java heap
size during the Remark phase, keeping the number of free regions
within these bounds.

In earlier OpenJDK releases, Eden regions were considered to be
occupied or full for this calculation. This made the heap size
dependent on the Eden occupancy at the time the Remark phase was
run. However, after the next garbage collection, these Eden regions
would be empty.

With this OpenJDK release, Eden regions are now considered empty or
free during the Remark phase calculation. The overall effect is that
G1 now expands the Java heap less aggressively and more
determinstically, as the number of free regions does not vary as much.
It also aligns Java heap sizing with the full GC heap sizing.
However, this may potentially lead to more garbage collections.

JDK-8315503: G1: Code root scan causes long GC pauses due to imbalanced iteration
=================================================================================
The Code Root Scan phase of garbage collection finds references to
Java objects within compiled code. To speed up this process, a cache
is maintained within each region of the compiled code that contains
references into the Java heap.

On the assumption that the set of references was small, previous
releases used a single thread per region to iterate through these
references. This introduced a scalability bottleneck, where
performance could be reduced if a particular region contained a large
number of references.

In this release, multiple threads are used, removing this bottleneck.

New in release OpenJDK 21.0.3 (2024-04-16):

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

tools/javac:

JDK-8317300: Align `javac` with the Java Language Specification by Rejecting `final` in Record Patterns
=======================================================================================================
Java 21 enhanced the language with pattern matching for switch
statements. However, the javac compiler released with OpenJDK 21
allowed the 'final' keyword to be used in front of a record pattern
(e.g. `case final R(...) ->`), which is a violation of the Java
Language specification.

With this release of OpenJDK 21, programs using `final` within a
switch statement will now fail to compile.  The erroneous keyword will
need to be removed to allow the program to be compiled.

security-libs/javax.xml.crypto:

JDK-8319124: Update XML Security for Java to 3.0.3
==================================================
The XML signature implementation in OpenJDK 21 has been updated to
Apache Santuario 3.0.3.  This update introduces four new SHA-3 based
RSA-MGF1 SignatureMethod algorithms.

However, the API of javax.xml.crypto.dsig.SignatureMethod can not be
changed in update releases to provide constants for these new
algorithms. The equivalent string literals should be used as below:

* SHA3_224_RSA_MGF1: "http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#sha3-224-rsa-MGF1"
* SHA3_256_RSA_MGF1: "http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#sha3-256-rsa-MGF1"
* SHA3_384_RSA_MGF1: "http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#sha3-384-rsa-MGF1"
* SHA3_512_RSA_MGF1: "http://www.w3.org/2007/05/xmldsig-more#sha3-512-rsa-MGF1"

hotspot/runtime:

JDK-8325496: Make TrimNativeHeapInterval a product switch
=========================================================
The option '-XX:TrimNativeHeapInterval=ms', where 'ms' is the interval
in milliseconds, is now an official product switch. It allows the
virtual machine to trim the native heap at the specified interval on
supported platforms (currently only Linux with glibc).  A value of
zero (the default) disables trimming.

client-libs/java.awt:

JDK-8322750: AWT SystemTray API Is Not Supported on Most Linux Desktops
=======================================================================
The java.awt.SystemTray API is used to interact with the system's
desktop taskbar to provide notifications and may include an icon
representing an application. The GNOME desktop's support for taskbar
icons has not worked properly for several years, due to a platform
bug. This bug, in turn, affects the JDK's SystemTray support on GNOME
desktops.

Therefore, in accordance with the SystemTray API specification,
java.awt.SystemTray.isSupported() will now return false on systems
that exhibit this bug, which is assumed to be those running a version
of GNOME Shell below 45.

The impact of this change is likely to be minimal, as users of the
SystemTray API should already be able to handle isSupported()
returning false and the system tray on such platforms has already been
unsupported for a number of years for all applications.

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8321408: Added Certainly R1 and E1 Root Certificates
========================================================
The following root certificate has been added to the cacerts
truststore:

Name: Certainly
Alias Name: certainlyrootr1
Distinguished Name: CN=Certainly Root R1, O=Certainly, C=US

Name: Certainly
Alias Name: certainlyroote1
Distinguished Name: CN=Certainly Root E1, O=Certainly, C=US

hotspot/gc:

JDK-8310031: Parallel: Precise Parallel Scanning of Large Object Arrays for Young Collection Roots
==================================================================================================
During the collection of young generation objects, the ParallelGC
collector partitions the old generation into 64kB stripes to scan for
references to the young generation. The stripes are assigned to worker
threads to do the scanning in parallel.

However, previous releases of OpenJDK 21 did not constrain these
worker threads to their own stripe. Parallelism was limited as a
single thread could end up scanning a large object with thousands of
references across multiple stripes, if it happened to start in its
allocated stripe. This also resulted in bad scaling, due to the
subsequent memory sharing associated with multiple threads working on
the same stripe.

In this release, workers are limited to their stripe and only process
interesting parts of large object arrays. Pauses for the ParallelGC
collector are now on par with the G1 collector when large object
arrays are present, reducing pause times by four to five times in some
cases.

JDK-8325074: ZGC fails assert(index == 0 || is_power_of_2(index)) failed: Incorrect load shift: 11
==================================================================================================
Running the virtual machine with `-XX:+UseZGC` and a non-default value
of `-XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes` had the potential to crash or perform
incorrect execution. This was due to `ZBarrierSet::clone_obj_array`
not taking into account padding words at the end of an ObjArray. This
has now been rectified in this release.

New in release OpenJDK 21.0.2 (2024-01-16):

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

core-libs/java.net:

JDK-8308593: Add KEEPALIVE Extended Socket Options Support for Windows
======================================================================
On Windows 10 version 1709 and above, TCP_KEEPIDLE and
TCP_KEEPINTERVAL are now supported in the
java.net.ExtendedSocketOptions class.  Similarly, on Windows 10
version 1703 and above, TCP_KEEPCOUNT is now supported.

hotspot/compiler:

JDK-8315082: [REDO] Generational ZGC: Tests crash with assert(index == 0 || is_power_of_2(index))
=================================================================================================
In the initial release of JDK 21, running the JVM with -XX:+UseZGC and
a non-default value of -XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes could lead to JVM
crashes or incorrect execution. This issue should now be resolved and
it should be possible to use these options again.

hotspot/runtime:

JDK-8317772: NMT: Make peak values available in release builds
==============================================================
The peak value is the highest value for committed memory in a given
Native Memory Tracking (NMT) category over the lifetime of the JVM
process. NMT reports will now show the peak value for all categories.

If the committed memory for a category is at its peak, NMT will
print "at peak". Otherwise, it prints the peak value.

For example, "Compiler (arena=196KB #4) (peak=6126KB #16)" shows that
compiler arena memory peaked above 6 MB, but now hovers around 200KB.

JDK-8313782: Add user-facing warning if THPs are enabled but cannot be used
===========================================================================
On Linux, the JVM will now print the following message to standard
output if Transparent Huge Pages (THPs) are requested, but are not
supported on the operating system:

"UseTransparentHugePages disabled; transparent huge pages are not
supported by the operating system."

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8317374: Added ISRG Root X2 CA Certificate from Let's Encrypt
=================================================================
The following root certificate has been added to the cacerts
truststore:

Name: Let's Encrypt
Alias Name: letsencryptisrgx2
Distinguished Name: CN=ISRG Root X2, O=Internet Security Research Group, C=US

JDK-8318759: Added Four Root Certificates from DigiCert, Inc.

Distinguished Name: CN=DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5, O="DigiCert, Inc.", C=US

JDK-8319187: Added Three Root Certificates from eMudhra Technologies Limited
============================================================================
The following root certificates have been added to the cacerts
truststore:

Name: eMudhra Technologies Limited
Alias Name: emsignrootcag1
Distinguished Name: CN=emSign Root CA - G1, O=eMudhra Technologies Limited, OU=emSign PKI, C=IN

Name: eMudhra Technologies Limited
Alias Name: emsigneccrootcag3

Name: eMudhra Technologies Limited
Alias Name: emsignrootcag2
Distinguished Name: CN=emSign Root CA - G2, O=eMudhra Technologies Limited, OU=emSign PKI, C=IN

JDK-8317373: Added Telia Root CA v2 Certificate
===============================================
The following root certificate has been added to the cacerts
truststore:

Name: Telia Root CA v2
Alias Name: teliarootcav2
Distinguished Name: CN=Telia Root CA v2, O=Telia Finland Oyj, C=FI ```

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

core-libs/java.util.jar:

JDK-8313765: Invalid CEN header (invalid zip64 extra data field size)
=====================================================================
Additional validity checks in the handling of Zip64 files,
JDK-8302483, introduced in 21.0.0, caused the use of some valid zip
files to now fail with the error, `Invalid CEN header (invalid zip64
extra data field size)`

This release, 21.0.1, allows for zero length headers and additional
padding produced by some Zip64 creation tools.

The following third party tools have also released patches to better
adhere to the ZIP File Format Specification:

* Apache Commons Compress fix for Empty CEN Zip64 Extra Headers fixed in Commons Compress release 1.11
* Apache Ant fix for Empty CEN Zip64 Extra Headers fixed in Ant 1.10.14
* BND issue with writing invalid Extra Headers fixed in BND 5.3

The maven-bundle-plugin 5.1.5 includes the BND 5.3 patch.

If these improved validation checks cause issues for deployed zip or
jar files, check how the file was created and whether patches are
available from the generating software to resolve the issue.  With
both JDK releases, the checks can be disabled by setting the new
system property, `jdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation` to
`true`.

hotspot/runtime:

JDK-8311981: JVM May Hang When Using Generational ZGC if a VM Handshake Stalls on Memory
========================================================================================
The JVM can hang under an uncommon condition that involves the JVM
running out of heap memory, the GC just starting a relocation phase to
reclaim memory, and a JVM thread-local Handshake asking to relocate an
object.  This potential deadlock should now be avoided in this
release.

core-libs/java.util.regex:

JDK-8312976: `java.util.regex.MatchResult` Might Throw `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` on Regex Patterns Containing Lookaheads and Lookbehinds
================================================================================================================================================
JDK-8132995 introduced an unintended regression when using instances
returned by `java.util.regex.Matcher.toMatchResult()`.

This regression happens with a `java.util.regex.Pattern`s containing
lookaheads and lookbehinds that, in turn, contain groups. If these are
located outside the match, a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` is
thrown when accessing these groups. See JDK-8312976 for an example.

The issue is resolved in this release by calculating a minimum start
location as part of the match result and using this in constructing
String objects, rather than the location of the first match.

JDK-8314960: Added Certigna Root CA Certificate
===============================================
The following root certificate has been added to the cacerts
truststore:

Name: Certigna (Dhimyotis)
Alias Name: certignarootca
Distinguished Name: CN=Certigna Root CA, OU=0002 48146308100036, O=Dhimyotis, C=FR

JDK-8312489: Increase Default Value of the System Property `jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize`
=========================================================================================
A maximum signature file size property, jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize,
was introduced in the 21.0.0 release of OpenJDK by JDK-8300596 to
control the maximum size of signature files in a signed JAR.  The
default value of 8MB proved to be too small for some JAR files. This
release, 21.0.1, increases it to 16MB.

New in release OpenJDK 21.0.0 (2023-09-XX):
===========================================
Major changes are listed below.  Some changes may have been backported
to earlier releases following their first appearance in OpenJDK 18
through to 21.

NEW FEATURES
============

Language Features
=================

Pattern Matching for switch
===========================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/406
https://openjdk.org/jeps/420
https://openjdk.org/jeps/427
https://openjdk.org/jeps/433
https://openjdk.org/jeps/441

Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for
`switch` expressions and statements, along with extensions to the
language of patterns. Extending pattern matching to `switch` allows an
expression to be tested against a number of patterns, each with a
specific action, so that complex data-oriented queries can be
expressed concisely and safely.

This was a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12)
introduced in OpenJDK 17 (JEP 406), which saw a second preview in
OpenJDK 18 (JEP 420), a third in OpenJDK 19 (JEP 427) and a fourth
(JEP 427) in OpenJDK 20.  It became final with OpenJDK 21 (JEP 441).

Record Patterns
===============
https://openjdk.org/jeps/405
https://openjdk.org/jeps/432
https://openjdk.org/jeps/440

Enhance the Java programming language with record patterns to
deconstruct record values. Record patterns and type patterns can be
nested to enable a powerful, declarative, and composable form of data
navigation and processing.

This was a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12) introduced
in OpenJDK 19 (JEP 405) with a second preview (JEP 432) in OpenJDK 20.
It became final with OpenJDK 21 (JEP 440).

String Templates
================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/430

Enhance the Java programming language with string templates. String
templates complement Java's existing string literals and text blocks
by coupling literal text with embedded expressions and template
processors to produce specialized results.

This is a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12) introduced
in OpenJDK 21 (JEP 430).

Unnamed Patterns and Variables
==============================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/443

Enhance the Java language with unnamed patterns, which match a record
component without stating the component's name or type, and unnamed
variables, which can be initialized but not used. Both are denoted by
an underscore character, _.

This is a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12) introduced
in OpenJDK 21 (JEP 443).

Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)
===================================================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/445

Evolve the Java language so that students can write their first
programs without needing to understand language features designed for
large programs. Far from using a separate dialect of Java, students
can write streamlined declarations for single-class programs and then
seamlessly expand their programs to use more advanced features as
their skills grow.

This is a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12) introduced
in OpenJDK 21 (JEP 445).

Library Features
================

UTF-8 by Default
================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/400

Specify UTF-8 as the default charset of the standard Java APIs. With
this change, APIs that depend upon the default charset will behave
consistently across all implementations, operating systems, locales,
and configurations.

Reimplement Core Reflection with Method Handles
===============================================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/416

Reimplement java.lang.reflect.Method, Constructor, and Field on top of
java.lang.invoke method handles. Making method handles the underlying
mechanism for reflection will reduce the maintenance and development
cost of both the java.lang.reflect and java.lang.invoke APIs.

Vector API
==========
https://openjdk.org/jeps/338
https://openjdk.org/jeps/414
https://openjdk.org/jeps/417
https://openjdk.org/jeps/426
https://openjdk.org/jeps/438
https://openjdk.org/jeps/448

Introduce an API to express vector computations that reliably compile
at runtime to optimal vector hardware instructions on supported CPU
architectures and thus achieve superior performance to equivalent
scalar computations.

This is an incubation feature (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/11)
introduced in OpenJDK 16 (JEP 338). A second round of incubation took
place in OpenJDK 17 (JEP 414), OpenJDK 18 (JEP 417) saw a third,
OpenJDK 19 a fourth (JEP 426), OpenJDK 20 (JEP 438) a fifth and
OpenJDK 21 a sixth (JEP 448).

Internet-Address Resolution SPI
===============================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/418

Define a service-provider interface (SPI) for host name and address
resolution, so that java.net.InetAddress can make use of resolvers
other than the platform's built-in resolver.

Foreign Function & Memory API
=============================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/412
https://openjdk.org/jeps/419
https://openjdk.org/jeps/424
https://openjdk.org/jeps/434
https://openjdk.org/jeps/442

Introduce an API by which Java programs can interoperate with code and
data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking foreign
functions (i.e., code outside the JVM), and by safely accessing
foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), the API enables
Java programs to call native libraries and process native data without
the brittleness and danger of JNI.

This API is now a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12).
It was first introduced in incubation
(https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/11) in OpenJDK 17 (JEP 412), and is an
evolution of the Foreign Memory Access API (OpenJDK 14 through 16) and
Foreign Linker API (OpenJDK 16) (see release notes for
java-17-openjdk). OpenJDK 18 saw a second round of incubation (JEP
419) before its inclusion as a preview in OpenJDK 19 (JEP 424) and a
second in OpenJDK 20 (JEP 434). It reaches a third preview in OpenJDK
21 (JEP 442).

Virtual Threads
===============
https://openjdk.org/jeps/425
https://openjdk.org/jeps/436
https://openjdk.org/jeps/444

Introduce virtual threads to the Java Platform. Virtual threads are
lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort of writing,
maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications.

This was a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12)
introduced in OpenJDK 19 (JEP 425) and reaching its second preview in
OpenJDK 20 (JEP 436).  It became final with OpenJDK 21 (JEP 444).

Structured Concurrency
======================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/428
https://openjdk.org/jeps/437
https://openjdk.org/jeps/453

Simplify multithreaded programming by introducing an API for
structured concurrency. Structured concurrency treats multiple tasks
running in different threads as a single unit of work, thereby
streamlining error handling and cancellation, improving reliability,
and enhancing observability.

This API is now a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12) in
OpenJDK 21 (JEP 453). It was first introduced in incubation
(https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/11) in OpenJDK 19 (JEP 428) and had a
second round of incubation in OpenJDK 20 (JEP 437).

Scoped Values
=============
https://openjdk.org/jeps/429

Introduce scoped values, which enable the sharing of immutable data
within and across threads. They are preferred to thread-local
variables, especially when using large numbers of virtual threads.

This API is now a preview feature (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12)
in OpenJDK 21 (JEP 429). It was first introduced in incubation
(https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/11) in OpenJDK 20 (JEP 429).

Sequenced Collections
=====================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/431

Introduce new interfaces to represent collections with a defined
encounter order. Each such collection has a well-defined first
element, second element, and so forth, up to the last element. It also
provides uniform APIs for accessing its first and last elements, and
for processing its elements in reverse order.

Key Encapsulation Mechanism API
===============================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/452

Introduce an API for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), an
encryption technique for securing symmetric keys using public key
cryptography.

Virtual Machine Enhancements
============================

Generational ZGC
================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/439

Improve application performance by extending the Z Garbage Collector
(ZGC) to maintain separate generations for young and old objects. This
will allow ZGC to collect young objects — which tend to die young —
more frequently.

Tools
=====

Simple Web Server
=================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/408

Provide a command-line tool, `jwebserver`, to start a minimal web
server that serves static files only. No CGI or servlet-like
functionality is available. This tool will be useful for prototyping,
ad-hoc coding, and testing purposes, particularly in educational
contexts.

Code Snippets in Java API Documentation
=======================================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/413

Introduce an @snippet tag for JavaDoc's Standard Doclet, to simplify
the inclusion of example source code in API documentation.

Ports
=====

Linux/RISC-V Port
=================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/422

RISC-V is a free and open-source RISC instruction set architecture
(ISA) designed originally at the University of California, Berkeley,
and now developed collaboratively under the sponsorship of RISC-V
International. It is already supported by a wide range of language
toolchains. With the increasing availability of RISC-V hardware, a
port of the JDK would be valuable.

DEPRECATIONS
============

Deprecate Finalization for Removal
==================================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/421

Deprecate finalization for removal in a future release. Finalization
remains enabled by default for now, but can be disabled to facilitate
early testing. In a future release it will be disabled by default, and
in a later release it will be removed. Maintainers of libraries and
applications that rely upon finalization should consider migrating to
other resource management techniques such as the try-with-resources
statement and cleaners.

Deprecate the Windows 32-bit x86 Port for Removal
=================================================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/449

Deprecate the Windows 32-bit x86 port, with the intent to remove it in
a future release.

Prepare to Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents
=================================================
https://openjdk.org/jeps/451

Issue warnings when agents are loaded dynamically into a running
JVM. These warnings aim to prepare users for a future release which
disallows the dynamic loading of agents by default in order to improve
integrity by default. Serviceability tools that load agents at startup
will not cause warnings to be issued in any release.
